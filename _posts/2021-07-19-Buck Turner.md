This is my friend Buck Turner, recently retired logger. He spent most of his 80 plus years in the woods of south Alabama. 
<p><i>“ I got lured into leaving once, a big city job ruined my mind. I spent about a week there then skedaddled right back home.”
There is something about the woods these big pine forests and swamps. Once you stay in em a while they're home and keep calling you back”.</i>
  
Buck is 86 and still a daylight to dark worker. He told me <i>"the only business school learning he needed was two things; when he went on a client's land to cut timber he acted like it was his mothers and treated it that way. Second thing is don't burn daylight, be in the woods when it gets light, quit when you cant see anymore and go straight home. Do this and it will all work out</i>.
  Buck is a smart man.
